#  Steerable Differential Beamformer using Linear Acoustic Vector Sensors (LAVS)

This repository contains a full **Google Colab / Python reimplementation** of  
**“A Novel Method to Design Steerable Differential Beamformer Using Linear Acoustics Vector Sensor Array”**  
*(IEEE TASLP 2023, Feng Chen et al.)*.

##  Overview
This work reproduces every analytical and simulation result from the paper:

| Phase | Description |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | AVS signal model and steering vector derivation |
| 2 | Beampattern formulation and baseline array response |
| 3 | First-order steerable differential beamformer |
| 4 | Second- and third-order beamformers |
| 5 | Directivity-factor (DF) analysis vs. steering angle |
| 6 | Frequency-independence validation |

All code is written in **pure NumPy + Matplotlib**, runs fully on **CPU**, and is verified against the original figures.
